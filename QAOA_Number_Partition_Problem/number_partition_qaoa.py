class number_partition_qaoa:
    ''' This class is used to solve the number partition problem using the QAOA algorithm.
    
    By taking the set and the edges and interaction matrix of the effective fully-connected
    Hamiltonian, the class constructs an ansatz for the QAOA state and uses it to obtain a 
    solution to the number partition problem. The ansatz is constructed by creating initial
    guesses of the angle parameters using a grid search method to obtain the parameters that 
    minimize the energy. These are then used as a seed for a Nerlder-Mead optimization 
    algorithm, which returns an optimal set of parameters that minimize the energy. Using these
    parameters, the QAOA circuit is run and a solution to the number partition problem is
    searched on the top five measurement outcomes.
