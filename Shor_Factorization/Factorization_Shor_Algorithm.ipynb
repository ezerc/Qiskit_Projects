    "This notebook contains a factorization function which efficiently implements Shor's Algorithm. This is an implementation presented in [1], which requires the use of $2n+3$ qubits. Given a specific number $N$ to factorize, the program performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check if $N$ is even. If so, return factor of 2, and offer to factorize $N/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Classically check if $N$ is a perfect power. If so, return factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. If $N$ does not fall into the previous categories, ask for an integer $a$ (this number needs to satisfy $gcd(a,N)=1$! ) to be used in the order finding quantum algorithm to obtain the period $r$ satisying $a^{r} mod N=1$ [2].\n",

    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. If $r$ is even, use $gcd(a^{r/2}-1,N)$ and $gcd(a^{r/2}+1,N)$ as guesses for factors of $N$ [2]. If $r$ is odd, go back to previous step and choose a different value for $a$.\n",

    "By default, the quantum algorithm runs in Qiskit's 'qasm_simulator', which can simulate up to 32 qubits, using 2048 trajectories. Interesting numbers to try out are 15 or 21, running higher numbers is at your own risk depending on the power of your local computer :).\n",
