# Qiskit Projects

In this repository I will be adding higher-level quantum-computing projects using qiskit, as the next step in my journey of learning about quantum computing. 

The first project has been creating a factorization program using an efficient implementation of Shor's Algorithm.

Stay tuned for more! :)
